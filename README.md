# DMC Media Viewer

The project was created as a test React frontend. The purpose was to address the lack of visual representation in the MSU Library's Games Collection search. By scraping and displaying game covers, it provides a more intuitive and engaging browsing experience. This project also enables the development of tailored search algorithms, specific to the library's collection, and the implementation of filters for different gaming consoles. These are all features currently lacking from the current search tool for the game collection since it's a tool made to search through literary media primarily.
